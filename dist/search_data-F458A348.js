Find an appropriate issue to solve:\n   * Only verified issues with complete information must be addressed (avoid issues with label `needs triage`, as they must be reviewed by the nomasystems group).\n   * If an issue is already assigned to another user, it means that this user is already solving the issue. Please, respect other people's work and don't interfere.\n   * Issues labeled with `good first issue` are quicker and simpler, so they can be a good starting point when contributing.\n2. Assign the issue to yourself, so other developers know that you are already working on it. Don't be ashamed if you find later that you won't be able to solve the issue, just left it unassigned so someone else can work on it.\n3. Create a branch to solve the issue:\n   * If the issue has the label `documentation`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `develop`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `docs/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n   * If the issue has the label `bug`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `main`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `fix/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n   * If the issue has the label `enhancement`:\n      - The new branch must be created from the branch named `develop`.\n      - The name of the new branch must be `feat/{IssueIdentifier}-{IssueTitle in kebab-case}`.\n4. Make the changes in the new branch.

If a commit closes an issue, the footer must include the expression `closes #IssueIdentifier`.\n5.
